How to set up a Elastic SIEM Lab

In this guide, I’ll walk you through steps on how to set up a home lab for Elastic Stack Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) using the Elastic Web portal and a Azure Kali Linux VM. You will also learn how to generate security events on the Kali VM, set up an agent to forward data to the SIEM, and query and analyze the logs in the SIEM. 

# Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following:

 - A fully set up Microsoft Azure account.
 - Basic knowledge of Linux and Azure.

# Overview of the tasks

  - Set up a free Elastic account.
  - Setup the Azure Kali VM.
  - Configure the Elastic Agent on the Linux VM to collect the logs and forward it to the SIEM.
  - Generate security events on the Kali VM.
  - Query to find the security events in the Elastic SIEM.
  - Create a Dashboard to visualize security events.
  - Create alerts for security events.

# Task 1: Set up an Elastic Account

Before we get started, we need to create a free account to set up a cloud Elastic instance that we can run the SIEM on. To do that, follow these steps:

  1. Sign up for a free trial to use Elastic Cloud at https://cloud.elastic.co/registration
  2. Once you have an Elastic account, log in to the Elastic Cloud console at https://cloud.elastic.co.
  3. Click on “Start your free trial.”
  4. Click on the “Create Deployment” button and select “Elasticsearch” as the deployment type.
  5. Choose a region and deployment size that fits your needs and click on “Create Deployment.”
  6. Wait for the configuration to complete.
  7. Once the deployment is ready, click “continue.”
